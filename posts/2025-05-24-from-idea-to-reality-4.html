                    <h3>The Integration Process: Customization and Adaptation</h3>
                    <p>
                        The `arduino-pico` project provides an existing Arduino Core for RP2 microcontrollers.<br>
                        However, to accommodate my custom board's unique specifications, a tailored integration process was necessary.<br><br>

                        <b> · Repository Forking and Customization:</b><br>
                            · I forked the `arduino-pico` repository on GitHub to create a personalized version.<br>
                            · This allowed me to incorporate my custom `pico-sdk` and integrate my board's specific configurations.<br>
                        <b> · Board Definition and Integration:</b><br>
                            · Integrating my custom board required modifications at various points within the Arduino Core.<br>
                            · This included defining the board's hardware characteristics, pin mappings, and other essential parameters.<br>
                            · This step ensures that the Arduino environment accurately reflects the capabilities of my custom hardware.<br>
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Leveraging `arduino-cli`: A Command-Line Approach</h3>
                    <p>
                        To interact with the Arduino ecosystem, I utilized `arduino-cli`, a command-line interface tool, installed on my Raspberry Pi.<br>

                        <b> · Command-Line Efficiency:</b><br>
                            · As a command-line enthusiast, I found `arduino-cli` to be a highly efficient and flexible tool.<br>
                            · It provides access to all the functionalities of the Arduino IDE through a familiar command-line interface.<br>
                        <b> · Streamlined Development Workflow:</b><br>
                            · `arduino-cli` facilitates a streamlined development workflow, enabling tasks such as compiling, uploading,<br>
                               and managing Arduino projects directly from the command line.<br>
                            · This is especially valuable for automated build processes and continuous integration.<br>
                        
                        By seamlessly integrating my custom RP2040 board into the Arduino ecosystem and leveraging `arduino-cli`,<br>
                        I have created a powerful and versatile development platform that combines the flexibility of custom hardware<br>
                        with the accessibility of a widely supported software environment.<br><br>

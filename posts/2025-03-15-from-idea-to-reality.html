                    <h3>The Spark of Curiosity: Diving Deeper into Embedded Systems</h3>
                    <p>
                        Fresh from earning my Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology,<br>
                        I felt a strong desire to solidify my theoretical knowledge with practical experience.<br>
                        While my academic journey had provided a solid foundation, I recognized a gap in my skillset: PCB design.<br><br>

                        This wasn't just about filling a resume bullet point; it was about truly understanding<br>
                        the intricate dance between hardware and software. I firmly believe that hands-on creation is the most<br>
                        effective way to learn, and I was eager to put that belief to the test.<br><br>

                        This personal project wasn't just about building a board; it was about building my understanding of embedded<br>
                        systems from the ground up. I wanted to move beyond the pre-made development boards and delve into the<br>
                        intricacies of custom hardware design.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Choosing the RP2040: A Microcontroller That Captured My Imagination</h3>
                    <p>
                        My previous microcontroller experience revolved around Arduino and SparkFun boards, staples of university courses.<br>
                        However, the announcement of the Raspberry Pi Pico and its RP2040 microcontroller sparked a new wave of interest.<br>
                        As a Raspberry Pi 3B owner, I was already familiar with the Raspberry Pi ecosystem. The RP2040's detailed datasheet,<br>
                        its wide availability, and the option to purchase the chip separately offered a level of flexibility and control that<br>
                        resonated with me.<br><br>
                        
                        The Raspberry Pi Hardware Design Guide served as an invaluable resource, providing the necessary technical<br>
                        information to guide my project. The RP2040's dual-core architecture and programmable I/O capabilities presented an<br>
                        exciting opportunity to explore more advanced embedded system concepts. I saw this project as a chance to push my<br>
                        boundaries and learn by doing.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Navigating the Software Landscape: Embracing Cloud-Based Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        My choice of software was heavily influenced by the limitations of my Chromebook. I needed a robust design tool that could<br>
                        operate seamlessly in a cloud-based environment. After extensive research, I discovered flux.ai, a cloud-native, AI-powered<br>
                        schematic and PCB design platform. Its intuitive interface and powerful features made it an ideal choice for my project.<br><br>

                        With flux.ai, I quickly set about designing the `Alyx Base V1`. I meticulously followed the Raspberry Pi Hardware Design Guide,<br>
                        ensuring that my design adhered to the recommended specifications.<br>
                        However, I decided to add a touch of modernity by incorporating a USB-C port, reflecting my desire to stay current with<br>
                        emerging technologies.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Manufacturing and the Reality Check: JLCPCB and the 0402 Challenge</h3>
                    <p>
                        For manufacturing, I chose JLCPCB, a decision I haven't regretted. Their user-friendly platform, competitive pricing,<br>
                        and reliable service made them an ideal partner for my project. I opted for self-assembly, eager to experience the<br>
                        entire process from design to fabrication. I ordered the PCBs from JLCPCB and sourced the components from DigiKey,<br>
                        ensuring that I had everything I needed to bring my design to life.<br><br>

                        However, the reality of soldering 0402 components quickly set in. These tiny passive components, measuring a mere<br>
                        1 mm x 0.5 mm, proved to be far more challenging to handle than I had anticipated. My skill level and available equipment<br>
                        were simply not up to the task. Furthermore, I discovered that the USB-C footprint I had chosen was incompatible with the<br>
                        selected component, a critical oversight that further compounded my difficulties. The `Alyx Base V1` ultimately proved to<br>
                        be a learning experience in failure. Despite my best efforts, the board was not functional. Undeterred, I recognized this<br>
                        setbackas an opportunity to learn and improve. I immediately began planning the `Alyx Base V2`, determined to apply the<br>
                        lessons learned from my initial attempt and create a successful custom RP2040 board.<br><br>

                        This first step, though fraught with challenges, was a crucial part of my journey into the world of custom hardware design.<br><br>
